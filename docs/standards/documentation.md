# Documentation Style

Write like IKEA instructions: clear, concise, direct.

Use complete sentences that are short but natural. Build information logically, one concept at a time.

Show with code examples. Add brief explanations when needed.

Keep examples hyper-focused on one concept. Remove anything that doesn't directly demonstrate the point.
